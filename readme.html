PLANTASIA APP – ABOUT

CONCEPT:
The Plantasia App is a browser-based ambient tone generator inspired by Mort Garson’s 1976 album *“Mother Earth’s Plantasia”*. Designed to be both musical and meditative, it generates evolving tones aligned with scientifically-supported plant frequency data and ambient sound design principles. The experience is meant for humans and plants alike—soothing, subtle, and harmonically tuned to nature.

FEATURES:
• Plant-Based Presets  
  - Selectable tone groups based on plants, mold, mushrooms, bacteria, and lifeform harmony.
  - Frequencies are drawn from solfeggio tones, biofeedback studies, and Camelot harmonic mixing keys.

• Melodic Pentatonic Tone Engine  
  - Uses randomized melodic patterns from each preset’s scale (no looping drones).
  - Playback is rhythmically synced to user-defined BPM.

• Oscillator Engine  
  - Each tone is produced by three layered, detuned square wave oscillators.
  - Adds warmth, texture, and harmonic depth (inspired by analog synths).

• Tape Wobble Simulation  
  - Each oscillator includes a unique low-frequency oscillator (LFO) for subtle pitch drift.
  - Simulates analog tape loop imperfections and fluid motion.

• Analog Envelopes  
  - Long, natural attack and release shapes give each tone a soft bloom and fade.
  - Mimics the organic phrasing of modular synthesis.

• Reverb, Delay, and Echo  
  - Adjustable delay and echo with feedback loop simulate vintage hardware.
  - Subtle stereo panning and reverb space enhance ambient immersion.

• Dynamic Visualizer  
  - Live waveform responds to tone output in real time.
  - Gradient color per preset, echo trails, and glow effects.
  - Canvas-based visuals designed to be gentle and meditative.

• Full User Control  
  - Sliders for Delay, Echo, Filter, Frequency, Volume, and BPM.
  - Dropdown presets dynamically change scale, waveform color, and slider values.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
• Black and white UI with subtle glowing color tied to sound
• No clutter, only essential controls
• Modular layout for mobile and desktop
• Inspired by scientific minimalism, analog synths, and nature-based color theory
